# neo4j-starter

A basic setup to get started with local neo4j development / experimentation.
This requires `docker`, `kubernetes` and `kind` being available on your machine.

## Roadmap

 * [ ] add Makefile for easy initialization
 * [ ] add some go starter code for neo4j connectivity
 * [ ] convert this to a nix flake (?)
